Claire Beardsley was cleaning out the attic in an old Southern California Craftsman House and
discovered a box full of papers, letters, and documents gathered by a woman who was active in
the women's movement in the 1940s. In it was a letter by the woman, who at the time was a
pivotal person in the women's suffrage movement, Alice Paul. She wrote the equal rights amendment, as well. Claire 
Beardsley was herself active in the Women's Movement in the 60s and thus was excited to find this 
box of over a thousand documents. In the late 60's Claire made a film of women doing what they did, grocery
shopping, laundry, and if you get bored watching this movie, that is exactly the point, women had few
other options.</p>
